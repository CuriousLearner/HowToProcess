#Trello documentation

##Boards:
Mozpacers has two boards:
-	*Non-Technical*: This board focuses on the tasks handled by the non-technical team such as documentation, localization, management of events, social media, etc.
-	*Technical*: This board focuses on the tasks handled by the technical team such as 	bug fixing, development, designing, testing, etc.

**Don’ts**: Don’t add new boards or delete existing ones unless you are asked to. You can always make suggestions to the trello moderators on our slack.

##Lists:
There are four types of lists in all Mozpacers boards:
-	*To Do*: This list enlists all the cards that are to be done in the future.
-	*In Progress*: This list enlists all the cards that are currently in progress.
-	*Completed and Pending Review*: This list enlists the cards that are completed by the the person/persons assigned and waiting for a review by our senior members.
-	*Done*: This list enlists the cards that are completed and reviewed.

**Don’ts**: Please don’t add new lists or delete existing ones unless you are asked to. You can always make suggestions to the trello moderators on our slack.
##Cards:
All cards are enlisted in top to bottom priority order. The card at the top carries the utmost priority. You can comment on cards, vote on them and subscribe to them. If you see your trello profile picture on a card that means that a trello moderator has assigned you the respective task. You’ll also receive the notification of the same. The moderator might also have added a due date and/or a checklist for you to follow. You can also attach files to a card but please only attach a file if you’re assigned the card or if you’re asked to do so by a trello moderator. You can ask for a task to be assigned to you. Cards can have several labels on their top. Here’s what they mean:
-	**For Non-Technical board**:
    -	*Green*: #wiki
    -	*Yellow*: #documentation
    -	*Orange*: #socialmedia
    -	*Red*: #event
    -	*Purple*: #mentorship
-	**For Technical board**:
    -	*Green*: #website
    -	*Yellow*: #bugsolving
    -	*Orange*: #idea
    -	*Red*: #innovation

**Don’ts**: Please do not add labels, checklists, due dates or move your cards around unless you are asked to. You can always make suggestions to the trello moderators on our slack.
